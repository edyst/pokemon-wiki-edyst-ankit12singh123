                    The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting
                    out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
                    themselves. A Reddit Pok√©mon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July
                    and December.

            Q and A
        </h2>
        <h4>Question Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into ?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of
                        Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
                        evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of
                        generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild.
                        Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Answer is Raichu
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game ?
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with,
                        but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild
                        Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've
                        reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is
                        a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Answer is Master Ball
                    </li>

                    Pok√©mon battles appear in most forms of Pok√©mon media, being the central gameplay aspect of the core
                    series games, as well as being a constant focus of the anime.

                <p>
                    Pok√©mon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pok√©mon games, but the effect of those
                    type matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have
                    slightly different multipliers to the main Pok√©mon games - although a December 2018 update brought
                    them slightly closer in line.
